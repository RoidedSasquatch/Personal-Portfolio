                <h3 id="about-me-job">Computer Programming/Analysis</h3>
                <p id="about-me-paragraph">Hello! My name is Dan, I am a programming/analysis student at Algonquin
                    College
                    in Ottawa, Canada. I am 26 years old and prior to beginning my program at Algonquin,
                    I completed an honours degree in psychology. After gaining more experience in the workforce as a
                    salesperson, I decided to revaluate my true passions and noticed that most of what I enjoy
                    relates to computing. I took my first programming class in high school, I remember being amazed at
                    what
                    I could do through a few lines of code, despite the fact that we were using Visual Basic 6 - an
                    older
                    programming language. As such, I applied to the computer programming and analysis program at
                    Algonquin
                    and got
                    accepted, and now find myself in my second year becoming increasingly grateful for all that I am
                    learning. My short time in this program has only reinforced my desire to become a software developer
                    and
                    I have even
                    on several personal java projects to further my learning. Ultimately, it is my dream to move to
                    British
                    Columbia with my girlfriend and start my own software development company - once I have some
                    experience
                    as a
                    developer with existing companies. BC is a special place to me as it is the first place I travelled
                    to
                    solo.

                    <h4>Skiing</h4>
                    <p>Skiing, both downhill and cros-country, have always been an important activity to me. I began to
                        ski
                        when I was a child
                        when I participated in multiple cross-country ski marathons. As I grew older, I became
                        interested in
                        Downhill skiing,
                        and more specifically, park skiing. Now it is one of my favourite hobbies of any season.

                    <h4>Hiking</h4>
                    <p>Hiking, is another outdoors-based hobby that I enjoy. I find hiking to be a very relaxing and
                        stress-relieving
                        activity. Some of the morst memorable hikes that I have been on were a part of a trip that I
                        took to
                        Vancouver in the Summer of 2022. I enjoy hiking both alone and as a part of a team!

                    <h4>Video Games</h4>
                    <p>Video games are another long-time passion of mine. I play a wide range of games ranging from
                        Strategy, to ARPG. My favourite title
                        in recent memory is FromSoftware's Elden Ring however other favourites include Squad, Counter
                        Strike, the SoulsBorne
                        series and Fallout. I play most of my games solo but do enjoy gaming with friends when our
                        schedules
                        align.

                    <h4>Programming</h4>
                    <p>Programming is one of my favourite hobbies, and will hopefully become my future career. Since
                        starting my program at
                        Algonquin I have started more personal projects than ever and often find myself writing code in
                        every ounce of spare
                        time that I can find. Currently, I am working on a Java Swing application that uses the JDBC
                        library
                        to connect to a
                        Postgres database to allow inventory manipulation.

                    <h4>Building Lego</h4>
                    <p>Lego represents an almost therapeutic hobby for me. I like to build with legos when I feel
                        stressed
                        or upset as I find that
                        the process of designing and creating new things to be relaxing. I also really enjoy building
                        the
                        pre-packaged lego sets
                        and am currently in the process of expanding my Lego Star Wars collection.
